Thanks to Mohammad Hejazi at BobCAD or providing this post processor and these instructions.

BobCAD requires the machine definition file and the post-processor file together in order to output the correct code.

# There are two ways to install post-processor and machine definition.

## Manual installation
1. Make sure BobCAD-CAM is closed
2. Move the Post Processor file "Buildbotics_OEM_3x_Mill.BCPst" into the default Post Processor folder location for desired BobCAD version. For example, if you are installing the post-processor for BobCAD-CAM V33, the default Post Processor folder location is as follow: C:\BobCAD-CAM Data\BobCAD-CAM V33\Posts\Mill
3. Move the machine definition folder "Buildbotics_OEM_3x_Mill" into the default MachSim folder location for desired BobCAD version. For example, if you are installing the machine definition for BobCAD-CAM V33, the default MachSim folder location is as follow: C:\BobCAD-CAM Data\BobCAD-CAM V33\MachSim
4. Once these files are transferred into the respective folders, Open the BobCAD to test the Post Processor output and update the machining results to ensure the functionality of the Post.
